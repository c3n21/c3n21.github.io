See the workflows in `.github/workflows/` for more details on automation. Explore the code for best practices in TypeScript, Astro, and modern frontend engineering.

# How does deployment work?
Every time there is push on `main` it will trigger the build pipeline and cache
the artifacts.

To actually do the deploy of the website and CV in release artifacts the following must be carried out:

1. Create a PR which only bumps the version named "Bump website version"
2. By merging the PR it will trigger the deploy pipeline
