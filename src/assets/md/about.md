Hi, I'm Zhifan â€“ a _developer_ passionate about software in all its forms.
While I primarily work as a frontend developer with React, my interests
extend to backend systems and infrastructure, where I enjoy working with
Terraform and Nix. I'm also a computer science student who loves open
source, contributing to the NeoVim ecosystem and Nix packages whenever I
find a functionality or package that could benefit both myself and the
community. I code in multiple languages, including Lua (for NeoVim
scripting), PHP, Java, and have a strong foundation in functional
programming with OCaml, Erlang, and Scala. Beyond work and studies, I'm
an avid NeoVim and NixOS enthusiast, constantly refining my workflow and
system configurations.
