    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
        Hi, I'm Zhifan â€“ a developer passionate about software in all its forms.
        While I primarily work as a frontend developer with React, my interests
        extend to backend systems and infrastructure, where I enjoy working with
        Terraform and Nix. I'm also a computer science student who loves open
        source, contributing to the NeoVim ecosystem and Nix packages whenever I
        find a functionality or package that could benefit both myself and the
        community. I code in multiple languages, including Lua (for NeoVim
        scripting), PHP, Java, and have a strong foundation in functional
        programming with OCaml, Erlang, and Scala. Beyond work and studies, I'm
        an avid NeoVim and NixOS enthusiast, constantly refining my workflow and
        system configurations.
    </p>
